# Summary

Wearable devices can track a multitude of parameters such as heart rate, body
temperature, blood oxygen saturation, acceleration, blood glucose and much more
`[@Kamisalic2018:2018]`. Moreover, they are becoming increasingly popular with a steeping
increase in market presence in 2020 alone `[@IDC2020:2020]`. Applications for wearable
devices vary from tracking cardiovascular risks `[@Bayoumy2021:2021]` to identifying
COVID-19 onset `[@Mishra2020:2020]`. Therefore, there is a great need for scientists to
easily go through data acquired from different wearables and to be able to share
them while protecting patient privacy.
In order to solve this problem and empower scientists working with biosignals,
we developed the **devicely** package. It represents the data in a science-friendly
format and contains tools for data deidentification. It allows scientists to focus
on what they want: the analysis of biosignals guided by privacy principles.

# Related Work

The first example of a package working with wearable data is mhealthtools `[@Snyder2020:2020]`, which is developed in R and focus on
extracting features from sensors such as inertial measurement units (IMUs). Its main difference from **devicely**
is firstly the language (R versus Python) and secondly their complementary
nature. Mhealthtools offers functionalities for feature extraction and
**devicely** is
intended to help users a step before by reading and writing data from
wearables into standardized formats.

There are also packages developed in python, such as SleepPy `[@Christakis2019:2019]` which uses raw
accelerometer data for assessing sleep quantity and quality. The HRV
 `[@Bartels2020:2020]` package uses csv and text files or python iterables such as lists to generate
features related to heart rate variability (HRV). GaitPy `[@Czech2019:2019]` accepts input data in a
customizable format and is mainly used to extract features for gait analysis.
Therefore, packages such as SleepPy, HRV and GaitPy could also be used as a
second step to extract features from the output generated by **devicely**.

FLIRT `[@Maritsch2020:2020]` is the only package that provides ways for
reading data from specific wearables such as Empatica E4. It also
includes functionalities to extract features from electrodermal activity (EDA),
acceleration and HRV. The main difference from FLIRT to **devicely** is the
focus on feature extraction versus privacy and data sharing.
FLIRT reads the data for extracting features, while **devicely** aims to provide users with
a way to read the data, deidentify them as necessary and write them back. In this
way, researchers can protect even more data privacy and use the data easily for
further analysis and sharing.


# Statement of need

Every wearable company has a different data format and reading them is
usually a challenge for scientists. Therefore, in order for researchers to be able to use different sensor data in an easy and
friendly way we developed the **devicely** package. The package also contains two methods to help with data deidentification, one
is called timeshift and the other is a write method. The idea behind them is
that researchers can timeshift all their time series data to a different time from the one the
actual experiments occurred and then write this new deidentified dataset back to
the original or a similar data format. This will empower scientists to keep patient privacy
and hopefully share more data to increase research reproducibility.

# Design

Different wearables come with different data formats which require different preprocessing steps.
However, it should be easy for scientists to add data from a new wearable to an
existing pipeline and easy for developers to add a new wearable to the
**devicely** package. To achieve both **devicely** encapsulates data preparation for
each wearable behind three common methods: reading, timeshifting and writing
data.

After reading, the data is accessible through the reader in common formats such as dataframes.
Deidentification is achieved by timeshifting the data, either by providing a shifting interval or randomly.
For writing back deidentified data **devicely** focuses on keeping a format that can be read again using the same reader class.
In almost all cases, this is the same format as the one the wearable originaly provides.
This enables sharing data with the community while maintaining patient privacy.


# Functionalities

All reader classes support three core functions: reading data created by a wearable, timeshifting them and writing them back.
To _read_ data the corresponding reader class can be initialized using as a
parameter a path to the data created by the wearable. After reading, data can
be accessed through the reader in convenient formats such as dictionaries
and dataframes.

After creating a reader object the method _timeshift_ can be applied upon it. This assures deidentification by shifting all time-related data points.
To control the shifting interval, a parameter can be provided to _timeshift_.
If no parameter is provided, the data is shifted by a random time interval to the past.
The timeshifted data can be written back using the _write_ method.

For all wearables, the written data can be read again using the same reader
class. Figure 1 depicts the class structure of the **devicely**
package and serves as a guide for future implementation.
