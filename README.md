devicely is a Python package for reading, deidentifying and writing data from various health monitoring sensors.
With devicely, you can read sensor data and have it easily accessible in dataframes.
You can also deidentify data and write them back using their original data format. This makes it convenient to share sensor data with other researchers while mantaining people's privacy.

## Supported sensors

- [Empatica E4](https://e4.empatica.com/e4-wristband) is a wearable device that offers real-time physiological data acquisition such as blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity (EDA), heart rate, interbeat intervals, 3-axis acceleration and skin temperature.

- [Biovotion Everion](https://www.biovotion.com/everion/) is a wearable device used for the continuous monitoring of vital signs. Currently, it measures the following vital signs: heart rate, blood pulse wave, heart rate variability, activity, SPO2, blood perfusion, respiration rate, steps, energy expenditure, skin temperature, EDA / galvanic skin response (GSR), barometric pressure and sleep.

- [1-lead ECG monitor Faros<sup>TM</sup> 180 from Bittium](https://shop.bittium.com/product/36/bittium-faros-180-solution-pack) is a one channel ECG monitor with sampling frequency up to 1000 Hz and a 3D acceleration sampling up to 100Hz.

- [Spacelabs](https://www.spacelabshealthcare.com/products/diagnostic-cardiology/abp-monitoring/90217a/) is an oscillometric blood pressure (BP) monitor which can be used to automatically track a person's BP in specificed time intervals.

- [TimeStamp for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gj.timestamp&hl=en), it allows you to record the timestamp of an event at the time it occurs. It also allows you to create specific tags such as "Running" or "Walking" and timestamp those specific activities.

- [Shimmer Consensys GSR](https://www.shimmersensing.com/products/gsr-optical-pulse-development-kit#specifications-tab) is a device that is used to collect sensor data in real time and it contains sensors such as GSR / EDA, photoplethysmography (PPG), 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis magnetometer & integrated altimeter.
